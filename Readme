# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases my journey across the four main stages of analytics:  
**Data Cleaning → Data Visualization → Data Modeling → Data Storytelling**  

Each project demonstrates how I approach real-world datasets, clean and process them, visualize trends, build models, and finally communicate insights in a storytelling format.
