# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio  

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases my end-to-end data analytics skills across four major areas:  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
2. **Data Visualization**  
3. **Data Modeling**  
4. **Data Storytelling**  

Each folder contains **real-world datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, and documentation (READMEs)** demonstrating specific analytics techniques.

## 🔹 Projects  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning  
Projects focused on transforming messy, raw data into structured, analysis-ready datasets.  

- **Coffee Survey Project**  
  - Cleaned a survey of 1,000+ coffee drinkers.  
  - Subsetted relevant columns, standardized names, and prepared data for further analysis.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas (column selection, renaming, handling missing values).  

- **Flight Delays Project**  
  - Cleaned US flight data and passenger logs.  
  - Combined multiple data sources, handled inconsistent formats, and prepared for visualization.  
  - *Skills:* Data merging, date-time cleaning, missing value handling.  

- **Top Songs Project**  
  - Cleaned Spotify/Top Song duration data.  
  - Standardized features and formatted dataset for time-series/EDA.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas transformations, CSV handling.

### 📈 Data Visualization  
Projects focused on turning data into clear, impactful visuals.  

- **Deepest Diving Animals Project**  
  - Visualized the maximum dive depths of various marine animals.  
  - Created comparative bar charts and annotated insights.  
  - *Skills:* Matplotlib, Seaborn, chart customization.

- **How Couples Met Project**  
  - Explored survey data from the *How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017* study.  
  - Visualized how dating trends have shifted over time (e.g., rise of online dating).  
  - *Skills:* Trend visualization, categorical comparisons, storytelling with social data.  

- **Granola & Healthy Food Perceptions Project**  
  - Based on a New York Times survey comparing what Americans vs. nutritionists consider “healthy.”  
  - Visualized perception gaps across multiple foods (e.g., sushi, granola, chocolate).  
  - *Skills:* Comparative visualization, survey data analysis, group comparison plots.

### 🤖 Data Modeling  
Projects focused on building predictive/statistical models and evaluating their performance.  

- **Tusked Elephant Project**  
  - Dataset: *Illegal tusk harvest and the decline of tusk size in the African elephant* (Chiyo et al., 2015).  
  - Compared elephant tusk lengths before (1966–68) and after (2005–13) widespread poaching.  
  - Built linear regression models for each period to quantify changes in the relationship between **shoulder height** and **tusk length**.  
  - Found a significant decline in tusk size relative to body size post-poaching, suggesting evolutionary pressures.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression (Scikit-learn), model evaluation (R²), comparative modeling, data storytelling through science.

### 📝 Data Storytelling   
Projects highlighting **business insights** and **narratives**:  
- From raw data → visualization → actionable recommendation.  
- Presenting insights in clear, non-technical language.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Environments:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Other Skills:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, reproducibility, storytelling
