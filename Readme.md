# üìä Data Analytics Portfolio  

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases my end-to-end data analytics skills across four major areas:  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
2. **Data Visualization**  
3. **Data Modeling**  
4. **Data Storytelling**  

Each folder contains **real-world datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, and documentation (READMEs)** demonstrating specific analytics techniques.

## üîπ Projects  

### üßπ Data Cleaning  
Projects focused on transforming messy, raw data into structured, analysis-ready datasets.  

- **Coffee Survey Project**  
  - Cleaned a survey of 1,000+ coffee drinkers.  
  - Subsetted relevant columns, standardized names, and prepared data for further analysis.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas (column selection, renaming, handling missing values).  

- **Flight Delays Project**  
  - Cleaned US flight data and passenger logs.  
  - Combined multiple data sources, handled inconsistent formats, and prepared for visualization.  
  - *Skills:* Data merging, date-time cleaning, missing value handling.  

- **Top Songs Project**  
  - Cleaned Spotify/Top Song duration data.  
  - Standardized features and formatted dataset for time-series/EDA.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas transformations, CSV handling.

### üìà Data Visualization  
Projects focused on turning data into clear, impactful visuals.  

- **How Couples Met Project**  
  - Explored survey data from the *How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017* study.  
  - Visualized how dating trends have shifted over time (e.g., rise of online dating).  
  - *Skills:* Trend visualization, categorical comparisons, storytelling with social data.  

- **Granola & Healthy Food Perceptions Project**  
  - Based on a New York Times survey comparing what Americans vs. nutritionists consider ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù  
  - Visualized perception gaps across multiple foods (e.g., sushi, granola, chocolate).  
  - *Skills:* Comparative visualization, survey data analysis, group comparison plots.

### ü§ñ Data Modeling  
Projects focused on building predictive/statistical models and evaluating their performance.  

- **Tusked Elephant Project**  
  - Dataset: *Illegal tusk harvest and the decline of tusk size in the African elephant* (Chiyo et al., 2015).  
  - Compared elephant tusk lengths before (1966‚Äì68) and after (2005‚Äì13) widespread poaching.  
  - Built linear regression models for each period to quantify changes in the relationship between **shoulder height** and **tusk length**.  
  - Found a significant decline in tusk size relative to body size post-poaching, suggesting evolutionary pressures.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression (Scikit-learn), model evaluation (R¬≤), comparative modeling, data storytelling through science.   

- **Lion Attacks Project**
  - Dataset: Lion attacks & belly sizes vs evening moonlight.  
  - Built custom Python linear models to explore how moonlight affects lion behavior.
  - Modeled both number of attacks and belly size, visualized relationships with scatter plots, and evaluated model performance using R¬≤.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, Custom Python Classes
 
- **E-Bike Stopping Distances Project**  
  - Dataset: *`ebike-stopping-distances.csv`, with supplemental low- and high-speed data.*  
  - Modeled the relationship between e-bike **speeds** and **stopping distances**.  
  - Started with a linear regression model, then fit a quadratic model to capture the curved relationship suggested by physics.  
  - Visualized predictions and validated the quadratic model against high-speed data for accuracy.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Model Evaluation (R¬≤), Data Visualization.

### üìù Data Storytelling   
Projects highlighting **business insights** and **narratives**

- **Plotting Animal Words Project**  
  - Dataset: *`animal-word-trends.csv` ‚Äì tracks historical usage frequency of animal words in printed materials from 1700 to 2019.*  
  - Built reusable plotting functions to visualize word usage trends over time for different animals.  
  - Explored historical events (e.g., invention of the automobile, completion of the transcontinental railway) to form hypotheses about changes in word usage.  
  - Investigated explanatory mechanisms for observed patterns, such as increased popularity of lobster following railway expansion.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Storytelling, Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Formation, Historical Data Interpretation.

- **Any Animal Except‚Ä¶ Project**  
  - Dataset: *`animal-word-trends-menageries.csv` ‚Äì tracks historical usage frequency of exotic animal words in British menageries from 1750 to 1835.*  
  - Investigated how public exhibitions in menageries influenced word usage trends for exotic animals.  
  - Compared trends for animals that were successfully exhibited (e.g., tiger, hyena, tapir) versus difficult-to-keep animals (e.g., hummingbird, chimpanzee, meerkat, penguin).  
  - Tested hypotheses on cultural exposure and accessibility, and extended analysis to Australian animals like kangaroo, wombat, and koala.  
  - *Skills:* Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Storytelling, Hypothesis Testing, Historical Data Interpretation, Exploratory Analysis.
