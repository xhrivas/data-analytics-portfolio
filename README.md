# The Ocean's Deep Diving Animals
Data visualization project exploring the deepest-diving ocean animals with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
📌 Repository Description

Deepest Diving Animals – Data Visualization Project

This project explores the question: How deep can air-breathing animals dive into the ocean? Using a dataset of the deepest recorded dive depths for over 100 species (including whales, seals, penguins, and more), the notebook demonstrates:

📊 Data Analysis with Pandas (loading, cleaning, grouping, aggregating).

📉 Data Visualization with Matplotlib, transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights.

🐋 Scientific Exploration, comparing dive depths across 10 different animal categories.

The project highlights data storytelling by evolving simple bar charts into engaging and informative visuals.
