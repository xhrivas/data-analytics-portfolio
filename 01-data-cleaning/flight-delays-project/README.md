Data Sources: I extracted the flight delay data using the anyflights package in R (https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights), which is similar to nycflights13 (https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13).

I selected ATL and the year 2023. This contains data on 336434 flights. I randomly took 5000 samples from this dataset. 


US Daily Passengers:
The passenger dataset comes from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which counts the number of people that go through TSA checkpoints each day.
